REQUIREMENTS
============

Claroline should work on the following Operating systems :

        Linux / BSD / Unix (*)
        Windows (9x, Me, NT4, 2000, XP)
        MacOs X.

  (*) Claroline have been tested on Red Hat, Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux
      distributions, but other UNIXes and Linux distributions should work too.
      We've received positive feedbacks from users working on Mandriva and Suse.
      
      We also heard of user managing to run Claroline on a Solaris box.
      
      Don't hesitate to notify us of any problem encountered on other
      Linux distributions or UNIX systems.

To install Claroline 1.9 on a computer, whether locally or remotely,
you need the following on your machine :

1. A web server. We recommend the use Apache, but Claroline is known to work
with IIS too and should work on any PHP-compatible web server.

2. PHP scripting language (version 5.1 or later), configured with the
   following modules : mysql, zlib, preg. Most of the PHP5 compiled
   distributions are provided with these modules. Anyway, their presence
   is checked by the Claroline install script.

   Some users could meet problems if their PHP setting doesn't fit
   these ones:

        safe_mode            = Off
        magic_quotes_runtime = Off
        short_open_tags      = Off

3. The MySQL databases server (version 4.23 or later) plus a login/password 
   allowing to administrate and create at least one database.

   Claroline can be installed in tow different modes : 'Single
   Database' and 'Multi Database'. In 'Multi Database' mode, Claroline
   will create a new database for each course created. This mode is
   sometimes more appropriate to manage a platform with a huge bulk of
   course sites. But it means the database account used by Claroline
   has to allow to create and administrate several databases. By
   default Claroline is set to be install on a 'single database host'
   If you want to use Claroline in 'Multi Database' mode, you have to
   select this option on purpose at install.

       WARNING ! If you use the 'single database' install option, it is
       recommended to use this database for Claroline use only. If you
       share this database with other applications, interferences could
       occurs between table names of both applications that could conducts
       to serious problems.

4. Web Write access to web directory where Claroline has been moved
   or unzipped to. On a Windows machine locally, this
   is not a problem. Remotely, you need to be allowed to CHMOD 755
   through FTP, telnet or any means.

5. A Mail Transport Agent (MTA). This not absolutely necessary but some
   Claroline features will remain silent if you don't provide MTA.
   Most Linux distributions provide MTA (Sendmail, Qmail, PostFix,
   ...). On Windows machines, no MTA are provided by default. You can
   either modify the php.ini file to redirect mail to an MTA available
   on an other machine, or install an MTA on the Claroline server.
   Several MTA are freely available for Windows (Mercury, Blat,
   Netmail95, WMailto , Hamster ...).

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

NEW CLAROLINE INSTALLATION
--------------------------

1. Download 'claroline19x.tar.gz' (UNIX, Linux) or 'claroline19x.zip' (Windows)

2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type

    tar -zxvf claroline19x.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline19x.zip' with your favorite application.

3. FTP or move by any means 'index.php' file and 'claroline' directory
   to your website on web server (whether web root or subdirectory).
   'index.php' should remain where it is, outside 'claroline' directory.
   
   UNIX and Linux : copy the claroline19x directory to the document root of your
   web server (typically /var/www/).
   
   Windows with wampserver : drag and drop the claroline19x
   directory to the wampserver ducument root folder, typically
   c:\Program Files\wamp\www\
   
   MacOSX with MAMP : drag and drop the claroline19x
   directory to the MAMP document root folder /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/

4. The following folders need to be readable, writeable and executable
   for everyone:
   
    - claroline19x/
    - claroline19x/platform
    - claroline19x/module and all its subfolders
   
   You can change the access rights from the command line under UNIX or Linux :
    chmod ugo+w claroline19x/
    chmod ugo+w claroline19x/platform
    chmod -R ugo+w claroline19x/module

4. Open Web Browser and go to

    http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/install/

   Windows : with wampserver locally, open:

    http://localhost/claroline/install/ (don't forget the final /).

   MacOSX : with MAMP locally, open:

    http://localhost:8888/claroline/install/ (don't forget the final /).

5. Follow instructions.

   Windows: if you use wampserver out of the box, default connection parameters
   for MySQL are login : root and no password
   
   MacOSX : if you use MAMP, default connection parameters
   for MySQL are login : root and password : root

UPDGRADE FROM PREVIOUS CLAROLINE VERSION
----------------------------------------

The upgrade works only from Claroline 1.5.x, 1.6.x, 1.7.x. and 1.8.x.

Older Claroline versions should upgrade first to Claroline 1.5.x before
upgrade to Claroline 1.9.x

Before upgrading we heavily recommend you do a full backup of the previous
Claroline directories and databases. If you are unsure how to achieve this
please ask your hosting provider for advice.

1. Download 'claroline19x.tar.gz'

   Windows : download 'claroline19x.zip'


2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type

    tar -zxvf claroline19x.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline19x.zip'


3. Replace your previous Claroline directory and index.php by the new one.

        WARNING ! Don't delete the previous directory before
        installing the new one. You will loose your previous
        configuration files (eg 'claro_main.conf.php'). Simply
        replace the old directory with a new one with a 'copy'
        command. That way, the new file versions will overwrite the
        old ones and leave the others intact.
        Configuration files are located in /platform/conf/

4. Open Web Browser and go to

   http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/admin/upgrade/upgrade.php

   Windows with easyPhp or WampServer locally, open:

   http://localhost/mydir/claroline/admin/upgrade/upgrade.php

5. Follow instructions.
